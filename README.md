# Cerebro

This project will contain both the Front-End code and the Back-End code for Cerebro. For the Back-End we use node.js running on the express framework. The Front-and Back end will be completely decoupled so it will be easy to change the backound without making any changes to the Front-End.

### Running the app

Runs like a typical express app:

    node app.js

### Running tests

Coming soon!
